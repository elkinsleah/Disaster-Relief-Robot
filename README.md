# Disaster-Relief-Robot
CopelliaSim bubbleRob Disaster Relief Project. Created a simulated robot that detects the location of victims after an earthquake. 

Using the CoppeliaSim virtual robot, I created a virtual prototype of an autonomous robotic recovery system that demonstrates goal-seeking behaviors in navigating through a predefined area.
